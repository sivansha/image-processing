## basics of image and video processing for streaming

This repository gives examples for image and video processing knowledge and techniques aimed ultimately for video streaming.
It cover basic image processing concepts such as measuring image quality after compression, and other subjects that are helpfull when streaming video.
All operation are also visualized via plots. 

Together with the [HAS simulation](https://gitlab.com/sivshani/has-simulation) repository it provides all the required basic knowledge and tools for advanced adaptable video streaming system.

### libraries used:
python3, numpy, opencv, mathplotlib, pil (pillow), FFMpeg, FFProbe, 

### subjects:
1. channels (BGR/RGB/YCbCr)
1. space conversions
1. histogram
1. entropy
1. filters, convolution, quantization
1. compression: fft, Haar transform
1. quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM)
1. motion vectors
1. Variable Bitrate Encoding (VBR)
1. Constant Bitrate Encoding (CBR).
1. Spatial and temporal information of videos
